This project focuses on Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning techniques. It provides a step-by-step guide on data preprocessing, feature selection, model building, and performance evaluation.

📌 Features: Data preprocessing and feature selection Handling imbalanced data using SMOTE Training and evaluating multiple classifiers Model performance assessment using accuracy, confusion matrix & classification report Saving the trained model using Pickle

The dataset has been sourced from Kaggle and contains customer-related information to determine churn probability.

Technologies & Libraries Used: Programming Language: Python

🛠️ Libraries Used: NumPy (numpy) Pandas (pandas) Matplotlib (matplotlib) Seaborn (seaborn) Scikit-learn (sklearn) Imbalanced-learn (imblearn) XGBoost (xgboost) Pickle (pickle)
